Python code for processing of natural sentences, including lemmatization, part of speech tagging, lexical features, averaging of lexical feature values, and various word- and sentence based analyses (with barplots for visualization).
Code somewhat outdated, new framework coming soon (2021).

### The following databases are used for lexical feature analysis:
